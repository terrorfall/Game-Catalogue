# Game Catalouge

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laravel/framework.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/laravel/framework)

In my quest to learn Laravel, I build a tool that allows me to catalouge all my retro games. There is more than likely an off-the-shelf product out there that will allow me to do the exact same thing, but there's no harm in reinventing the wheel in the quest for greater knowledge.

## Setup

This is a standard Laravel installation, nothing special. Just run `composer install` once cloned.

## Upcoming Features

* Display search/filter results
* Show duplicate games
* Pagination
* Neater timestamps
* Ability to add multiple users with various access rights
* Game lists for multiple users under same platform install
* List of users with profile pages
* A logged out front page
* Game cover images (hello legal minefield!)
